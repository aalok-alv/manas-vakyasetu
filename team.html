  <!-- TEAM INTRO -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is developed under the <strong>MANAS</strong> initiative, a collaborative
      effort focused on creating human-centered assistive technologies. The team operates
      with a research-first mindset, emphasizing learning, experimentation, and responsible
      engineering.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- TEAM STRUCTURE -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Team Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The project is built through interdisciplinary collaboration. Each member contributes
      across multiple domains while maintaining clear responsibility areas to ensure system
      integrity and progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Core contribution areas include hardware development, software engineering, system
      integration, documentation, and research analysis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- MANAS -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>The MANAS Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      MANAS is a learning-driven initiative aimed at developing accessible and ethical
      technology solutions. Projects under MANAS focus on real-world problems, especially
      those affecting individuals with limited access to advanced technological resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu represents one such effort, combining practical engineering with social
      responsibility.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      The long-term vision of Vakyasetu is to contribute toward a future where communication
      barriers caused by physical limitations can be reduced through simple, affordable,
      and adaptable technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project does not aim to replace existing medical or therapeutic solutions, but to
      complement them by providing additional tools for expression and interaction.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ROADMAP -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Short-Term:</strong> Improve sensor reliability, refine signal interpretation,
      and conduct controlled user testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mid-Term:</strong> Expand gesture vocabulary, enhance software adaptability,
      and improve system modularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Long-Term:</strong> Collaborate with researchers and institutions, explore
      integration with other assistive systems, and study scalability options.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ETHICS -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Ethical Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is built with a strong ethical foundation. User dignity, transparency,
      and non-invasive assistance guide every design decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team remains committed to responsible development, ensuring that technology
      empowers users without introducing dependency or unnecessary complexity.
