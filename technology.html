  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is built on a layered architecture that tightly integrates hardware sensing
      with software-based interpretation. The system is designed to be modular, transparent,
      and efficient, ensuring that each component can be independently improved or replaced
      without disrupting the entire workflow.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PIPELINE -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>End-to-End Processing Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      The core operation of Vakyasetu follows a structured signal flow:
    </p>
    <p>
      Touch Input → Signal Acquisition → Data Normalization → Matrix-Based Mapping → Output Generation
    </p>
    <p>
      This pipeline ensures that raw physical interactions are converted into meaningful
      communication outputs with minimal latency and high consistency.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- HARDWARE -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Hardware Layer</h2>
    <p>
      The hardware layer consists of touch sensors positioned to capture intentional hand
      interactions. These sensors are selected for sensitivity and reliability, allowing
      the system to detect even low-force inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensor data is routed through a microcontroller interface, where it is digitized and
      prepared for software-level processing. The design prioritizes comfort, low power
      consumption, and ease of integration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SOFTWARE -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Software Layer</h2>
    <p>
      The software system is implemented using Python and is responsible for interpreting
      incoming sensor data. Instead of relying on heavy machine learning models, the system
      uses structured logic to maintain transparency and predictability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach allows developers and researchers to clearly understand how inputs
      translate into outputs, making the system easier to debug, optimize, and adapt.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- MATRIX LOGIC -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Matrix-Based Interpretation Logic</h2>
    <p>
      At the core of the software layer lies a matrix-based mapping mechanism. Each sensor
      input pattern corresponds to a predefined position within a logical matrix that
      represents specific words, phrases, or commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method enables fast lookups, reduced computational overhead, and deterministic
      behavior—critical properties for assistive communication systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DESIGN PHILOSOPHY -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is intentionally designed to avoid invasive techniques and opaque decision
      systems. The emphasis is placed on user dignity, system reliability, and long-term
      adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every design decision is guided by the principle that assistive technology should
      empower users without introducing unnecessary complexity.
