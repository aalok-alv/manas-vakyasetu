    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is an assistive communication system designed to help individuals with paralysis
      express intent through minimal physical interaction. The project focuses on translating
      simple hand-based touch inputs into meaningful communication using a tightly integrated
      hardware and software approach.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      For many paralysed individuals, the loss of speech or motor control creates a severe
      communication barrier. Existing solutions often rely on expensive equipment, invasive
      technologies, or complex calibration processes that are difficult to access, maintain,
      or scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In low-resource environments, these limitations become even more critical, leaving
      individuals dependent on others for even basic communication.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- IDEA -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu approaches the problem from a different direction. Instead of requiring full
      motion or speech, it leverages small, intentional hand interactions detected through
      touch sensors. These interactions are interpreted by software logic that maps signals
      to predefined meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is built to work with minimal effort from the user, prioritizing comfort,
      simplicity, and clarity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>What Vakyasetu Does</h2>
    <p>
      The system captures touch-based input, processes the signal using structured algorithms,
      and converts the result into understandable output such as words, phrases, or commands.
      This allows users to communicate without relying on speech or full limb movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design emphasizes reliability and repeatability, ensuring that small actions lead
      to consistent outcomes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DIFFERENTIATION -->
  <div class="panel">
    <h2>Why This Approach Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Vakyasetu is not designed as a closed or rigid solution. It is modular, adaptable,
      and learning-oriented. Both the hardware and software components are structured to
      evolve based on user needs and future research.
    </p>
    <p>
      By focusing on affordability, transparency, and ease of use, the project aims to
      lower the entry barrier for assistive communication technology.
